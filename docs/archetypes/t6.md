# T6 - Prediction Mismatch

**MAST Mode**: FM-2.6 (Reasoning-action mismatch)

**Pattern**: Calibrated predictions systematically wrong due to unlikely branches

## Description

T6 demonstrates **calibration failure**:

- Questions have split_ratio ≥ 0.5 (majority would answer YES)
- Secret is chosen to answer NO (minority branch)
- Calibrated argmax predicts YES, oracle says NO
- Repeated mismatches expose the gap between belief and reality

## Generation

**Mode**: Secret-first

```bash
python run.py single --type T6
```

The secret-first mode selects a secret that takes minority branches.

## Gate Validator

```python
def validate_t6_gate(trajectory):
    # No specific world constraints - always passes
    # The mismatch is created by secret selection
    return PASS
```

## Example Trajectory

**Secret**: Anchor (index 2)

| Turn | Question | Answer | split | Prediction | Match? |
|------|----------|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | "Is it alive?" | NO | 0.70 | YES | ❌ |
| 2 | "Is it used indoors?" | NO | 0.65 | YES | ❌ |
| 3 | "Is it colorful?" | NO | 0.55 | YES | ❌ |
| 4 | "Is it made of metal?" | YES | 0.52 | YES | ✅ |
| 5 | "Is it used on boats?" | YES | 0.50 | YES | ✅ |
| 6 | "Is it an anchor?" | YES | 1.0 | YES | ✅ |

## The Mismatch Pattern

```
Turn 1: p_yes=0.70, predict=YES, actual=NO  → MISMATCH
Turn 2: p_yes=0.65, predict=YES, actual=NO  → MISMATCH
Turn 3: p_yes=0.55, predict=YES, actual=NO  → MISMATCH
```

The calibrated predictor is doing the "right" thing (predicting majority), but the world is adversarial.

## Why FM-2.6

**Reasoning**: "70% of items would answer YES, so I predict YES"

**Action outcome**: The oracle answered NO

This is a **reasoning-action mismatch** - the agent's stated reasoning led to an incorrect prediction, not because the reasoning was flawed, but because the world selected against it.

## Training Implications

T6 teaches:

1. **Calibration ≠ accuracy** - Being well-calibrated means being wrong 30% of the time when p=0.70
2. **Epistemic humility** - Majority vote doesn't guarantee correctness
3. **Update on evidence** - After seeing NO, update beliefs appropriately

## Difference from T2

| Aspect | T2 | T6 |
|--------|----|----|
| Generation | Path-first | Secret-first |
| Branch rarity | Very rare (p < 0.15) | Moderately rare (0.3-0.5) |
| Entropy drop | Sharp | Gradual |
| Mismatch frequency | Sporadic | Consistent |
