# T8 - Wrong Verification

**MAST Mode**: FM-3.3 (Incorrect Verification)

**Pattern**: Agent makes an incorrect guess with a false verification claim

## Description

T8 trajectories demonstrate **incorrect verification** - the agent:

1. Commits to a guess while multiple items remain feasible
2. Provides a verification claim that (falsely) asserts consistency
3. Gets rejected (`stop_accepted=false`)
4. Continues and eventually finds the correct answer

This is the canonical example for RL training because it contains both failure and recovery.

## Generation

**Mode**: Path-first

**Required overlay**: `--termination wrong_guess`

```bash
python run.py single --type T8 --termination wrong_guess
```

## Gate Validator

```python
def validate_t8_gate(trajectory):
    # Must have wrong guess with verification claim
    for turn in trajectory.turns:
        if turn.guess and not turn.guess_correct:
            if turn.guess.verification_claim:
                return PASS
    return FAIL
```

## Example Trajectory

**Secret**: Horse (index 56)

| Turn | Question | Answer | H | \|S\| | Action |
|------|----------|--------|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | "leisure activities?" | YES | 6.0 | 64 | continue |
| 2 | "professional purposes?" | YES | 5.0 | 32 | continue |
| 3 | "found in store?" | NO | 2.3 | 5 | continue |
| 4 | "used for decoration?" | NO | 1.6 | 3 | **GUESS (wrong)** |
| 5 | "smaller than car?" | YES | 1.0 | 2 | continue |
| 6 | "inanimate object?" | NO | 0.0 | 1 | GUESS (correct) |

### Turn 4 Detail

```json
{
  "turn": 4,
  "entropy_after": 1.58,
  "model_action": "guess",
  "guess": {
    "secret": "Watermelon",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "verification_claim": "The secret must be 'Watermelon' because
      the answer to 'Is it used for leisure activities?' was Yes,
      which is consistent with 'Watermelon'."
  },
  "guess_correct": false,
  "stop_accepted": false
}
```

## Why This is FM-3.3

The verification claim is **incorrect** because:

1. "Consistent with Watermelon" is true but insufficient
2. Horse and 1 other item are also consistent
3. The agent conflated *consistency* with *uniqueness*

## Training Signal

| Turn | State | Action | Reward | Lesson |
|------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 4 | H=1.6 | GUESS | -0.9 | Don't guess at H>0 with high confidence |
| 6 | H=0 | GUESS | +1.0 | Guess when H=0 |
